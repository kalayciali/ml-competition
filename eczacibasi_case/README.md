For this case, I try to construct Sales interface with many methods for analytics of sales dataset. It isn't quite user friendly. There are things that could be added. But this is what my aim is.

I used Poisson Regression. There was not enough data for fancy Neural Networks or Gradient Boosted Decision Trees to infer smt meaningful. On the other hand, Poisson Regression fit better "naturally". So I finished this case as 1.
